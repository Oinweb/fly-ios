Description:
Level up your financial literacy today! FLY (Financial Literacy for Youth) was designed as a unique non-profit and open source collaboration between
Ontario Immigrant Network (oinweb.ca) and Libro Credit Union (Libro.ca). FLY offers quick and easy to understand information on savings, credit, and debt, while helping
you to track and achieve your financial goals. Featuring social sign in, FLY is probably the easiest to use app of its kind, and support for French and Spanish will follow shortly.
